# Checkpoint

Checkpoint is a WIP web extension that adds a small, configurable nudge to help yourself in beating compulsive visits to certain websites that you choose. For example, this may help with compulsive visits to social media, anxiety induced health-related googling, or just anything that you do without thinking in general.
